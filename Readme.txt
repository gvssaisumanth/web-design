# web-design Portfolio

I have designed a responsive portfolio webiste using various HTML/HTML5 tags, CSS and various BOOTSTRAP components.
Added media queries to make the website responsive in any device.

1. Used an external CSS file only
2 Used  float in nav bar
3 Used  column layout structure while building and stacking/spacing cards
4 Used  absolute/relative position for responsiveness where needed
5 Used tel, mailto option for contact information
